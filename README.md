## Bash script for launching an AWS instance to run demos from source code

This isn't generic at all but you can see how to do this for the following types of projects:

2. Angular2 project
3. Ruby on Rails

This is using a plain vanilla Ubuntu AMI so the main issue is getting the prerequites installed on the server.
